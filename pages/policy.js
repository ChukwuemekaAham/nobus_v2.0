              How We Share Personal Information
            </h4>

            <div className="pb-2">
              <p>
                Information about our customers is an important part of our
                business and we are not in the business of selling our
                customers’ personal information to others. We share personal
                information only as described below and with Nkponani Limited
                and any subsidiaries that Nkponani controls that are either
                subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as
                protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.
              </p>

              <li>
                Transactions Involving Third Parties: We make available to you
                services, software, and content provided by third parties for
                use on or through NCS Services. You can tell when a third party
                is involved in your transactions, and we share information
                related to those transactions with that third party. For
                example, you can order services, software, and content from
                sellers using the NCS dashboard and we provide those sellers
                information to facilitate your subscription, purchases, or
                support.
              </li>

              <li>
                Third-Party Service Providers: We employ other companies and
                individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples
                include: delivering NCS hardware, sending communications,
                processing payments, assessing credit and compliance risks,
                analyzing data, providing marketing and sales assistance
                (including advertising and event management), conducting
                customer relationship management, and providing training. These
                third party service providers have access to personal
                information needed to perform their functions, but may not use
                it for other purposes. Further, they must process that
                information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as
                permitted by applicable data protection law.
              </li>

              <li>
                Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we
                might sell or buy businesses or services. In such transactions,
                personal information generally is one of the transferred
                business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any
                pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the individual
                consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that NCS or
                substantially all of its assets are acquired, your information
                will of course be one of the transferred assets.
              </li>

              <li>
                Protection of Us and Others: We release account and other
                personal information when we believe release is appropriate to
                comply with the law, enforce or apply our terms and other
                agreements, or protect the rights, property, or security of NCS,
                our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information
                with other companies and organizations for fraud prevention and
                detection and credit risk reduction.
              </li>

              <li>
                At Your Option: Other than as set out above, you will receive
                notice when personal information about you might be shared with
                third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to
                share the information.
