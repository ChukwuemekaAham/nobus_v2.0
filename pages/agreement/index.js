              This NCS Customer Agreement (this “Agreement”) contains the terms
              and conditions that govern your access to and use of the Service
              Offerings (as defined below) and is an agreement between the
              applicable NCS Contracting Party specified in Section 14 below
              (also referred to as “NCS,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) and you or the
              entity you represent (“you” or “your”). This Agreement takes
              effect when you click an “I Accept” button or check box presented
              with these terms or, if earlier, when you use any of the Service
              Offerings (the “Effective Date”). You represent to us that you are
              lawfully able to enter into contracts (e.g., you are not a minor).
              If you are entering into this Agreement for an entity, such as the
              company you work for, you represent to us that you have legal
              authority to bind that entity. Please see Section 14 for
              definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement.

                <b>5.1 Service Fees. </b>We calculate and bill fees and charges
                monthly, quarterly or annually depending on your selection. All
                fees are billed immediately resources are provisioned or
                activated. You will pay us the applicable fees and charges for
                use of the Service Offerings as described on the NCS Site using
                one of the payment methods we support. All amounts payable by
                you under this Agreement will be paid to us without setoff or
                counterclaim, and without any deduction or withholding. Fees and
                charges for any new Service or new feature of a Service will be
                effective when we post updated fees and charges on the NCS Site,
                unless we expressly state otherwise in a notice. We may increase
                or add new fees and charges for any existing Services you are
                using by giving you at least 30 days’ prior notice. We may elect
                to charge you interest at the rate of 2.5% per month (or the
                highest rate permitted by law, if less) on all late payments
                when applicable and if services are not billed in advance.

                <b> 5.2 Taxes. </b>Each party will be responsible, as required
                under applicable law, for identifying and paying all taxes and
                other governmental fees and charges (and any penalties,
                interest, and other additions thereto) that are imposed on that
                party upon or with respect to the transactions and payments
                under this Agreement. All fees payable by you are exclusive of
                Indirect Taxes. We may charge and you will pay applicable
                Indirect Taxes that we are legally obligated or authorized to
                collect from you. You will provide such information to us as
                reasonably required to determine whether we are obligated to
                collect Indirect Taxes from you. We will not collect, and you
                will not pay, any Indirect Tax for which you furnish us a
                properly completed exemption certificate or a direct payment
                permit certificate for which we may claim an available exemption
                from such Indirect Tax. All payments made by you to us under
                this Agreement will be made free and clear of any deduction or
                withholding, as may be required by law. If any such deduction or
                withholding (including but not limited to cross-border
                withholding taxes) is required on any payment, you will pay such
                additional amounts as are necessary so that the net amount
                received by us is equal to the amount then due and payable under
                this Agreement. We will provide you with such tax forms as are
                reasonably requested in order to reduce or eliminate the amount
                of any withholding or deduction for taxes in respect of payments
                made under this Agreement.{" "}

                reference to conflict of law rules, govern this Agreement and
                any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and us. The

                <b> 13.5 Disputes. </b>Any dispute or claim relating in any way
                to your use of the Service Offerings, or to any products or
                services sold or distributed by NCS will be adjudicated in the
                Governing Courts, and you consent to exclusive jurisdiction and
                venue in the Governing Courts, subject to the additional
                provisions below.

              <p>
                (a) Disputes will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather
                than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims
                court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and
                federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement. There is no
                judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration
                award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an
                individual basis the same damages and relief as a court
                (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory
                damages), and must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court
                would. The arbitration will be conducted by the Nigeria Court of
                Arbitration in Enugu State under its rules, which are available
                at{" "}

                We will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless
                the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may
                choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on
                written submissions, or at a mutually agreed location. We and
                you agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be
                conducted only on an individual basis and not in a className,
                consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim
                proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we and you waive
                any right to a jury trial. Notwithstanding the foregoing we and
                you both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin
                infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
