                NCS will not access or use, or disclose to any third party, any
                Customer Data, except, in each case, as necessary to maintain or
                provide the Services, or as necessary to comply with the law or
                a valid and binding order of a governmental body (such as a
                subpoena or court order). If a governmental body sends NCS a
                demand for Customer Data, NCS will attempt to redirect the
                governmental body to request that data directly from Customer.
                As part of this effort, NCS may provide Customer’s basic contact
                information to the governmental body. If compelled to disclose
                Customer Data to a governmental body, then NCS will give
                Customer reasonable notice of the demand to allow Customer to
                seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy unless NCS
                is legally prohibited from doing so. If the Standard Contractual
                Clauses apply, nothing in this Section 3 varies or modifies the
                Standard Contractual Clauses.{" "}

                out processing activities on Customer Data on behalf of
                Customer, NCS will update the applicable website and provide
                Customer with a mechanism to obtain notice of that update. If

                also maintains electronic intrusion detection systems designed
                to detect unauthorised access to the Facilities, including
                monitoring points of vulnerability (e.g., primary entry doors,
                emergency egress doors, roof hatches, dock bay doors, etc.) with
